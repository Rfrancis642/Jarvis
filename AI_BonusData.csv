1/1/2001,,3,Letter to parents downloaded blank.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Hard to find information. Video tutorials would be nice.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,"On the mobile app, I was trying to add the ""READS"" free book, but the ""confirm and apply"" button was below the screen and I couldn't scroll far enough to be able to click it. On the computer it worked fine.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,Took me awhile.  Not super user friendly.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Not finding info,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Need larger pictures to show children the available books.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,"Easy to add items to wish list and cart. Sometimes navigation is difficult (e.g., once get to checkout, it would be nice to have a back button ('back to shopping'), rather than using the browser back button or having to go back 'home' and navigate back to where I was before entering checkout).",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"I had trouble finding where to submit my child’s teacher & when I found it, my entire cart was deleted so I had to start over. It would be better if the scholastic site worked seamlessly with the school classroom pages.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,2,It will not add to my cart at all and I can't order.    I have a credit that I can't use.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,"Site worked great! The search function under the site search was a little confusing since it only had the ""add to cart"" button there instead of going to the item to view the descrip. I get the idea of it, just wasn't prepared for it. This is so much easier than filling out those awful newsprint, tiny order forms lol",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,I feel like there should be an easier search function,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,Wish there was a way to edit a letter to attach to the student flyers.      Such as fonts and size.  I can't figure that out.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Search function is not great,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Had trouble going back to the $1.00 page : D,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,The site is not easy to navigate.  I feel like you have to click around a lot to find the best deals for teachers.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"I find the site has not been updated in 3 years, since I was last in the classroom. It is not the most user-friendly to maneuver in between the teacher wish list and book selecting. I wish multiple books could be added at once instead of one at a time.     It would be nice to have received physical copies of flyers.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,Just still looking for where to do this. :),FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Not an easy site to navigate and prices have gone up.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,It is still not easy to quickly find what I want and switch back and forth between items.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"Your site is not easy to follow to order the books. I had to use the sheets that were sent home from the school and then search for each book using the item number. I was not impressed with the site. I would recommend the books, but I would also warn everyone about using the site.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"should be able to place books in ""shopping cart"" directly from the digital flyer. The numbers on the digital flyer are too small to easily read. Should be listed when click on the book.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,Kept freezing on the flyer's.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,"I could not print my printable teacher letter - I got a screen with ""bad response"" instead.  I opened it in an incognito window and it worked.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,1,when I am at checkout and have $ to use - I should be able to pull up my wish list and add those books in.  This is very frustrating.  The system really needs to be easier for teachers.  We don't have time to navigate back and forth.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,very well placed categories ans recommendations. Only feedback is that when I was on a recommendation page I liked 2 books and I clicked on 1 to add to cart but after that I couldnot go back to the same recommendation page and missed the second book I had liked. I then had to search for it again.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,The survey popped up before I could complete what I was doing.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,Sometimes I find it hard to locate the collection deals or the book of the week sale,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,I am not sure that the entire process is intuitive but I am muddling through.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,Keep me logged in once I log in,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,The process to confirm an online order placed by a parent is overly complicated & redundant.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,A couple search challenges. Typed in a book I knew was there and it didn't come up.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,"I find the site hard to navigate.  The collections can sometimes be helpful, but it would be nice to be able to just look through all titles at once.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,It timed out and did not keep what I had done. I had to re-enter everything.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,I cannot print or download the parent letter.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,Some of the digital flyers would not load to view.,FALSE,,,,

1/1/2001,,4,The button to SEE ALL in a section doesn't stand out easily,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,"Site is easy to navigate. However, I did not see the bonus catalog section. I will look when I submit order on Wednesday.  Thanks for the $1.00 book section. helps me with birthday books and holiday books.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,It would be great if you had a way to sort by price or browse for books below a certain price point.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,cant search for a book,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,"I wish there was a way to search or sort by price. For example, as a parent (or a teacher) looking to build my library on a tight budget, I'd love to search for all the $1 and under books. Or knowing that Scholastic has dollar deals, all the $2 books.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Just initial navigation is a little confusing,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,The way the free book code needed to be entered was a bit confusing. I ended up ordering two copies of the same book.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,1,The page is stuck on the check out screen  Very frustrating,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"I tried on my phone to enter a free book and submit my order,but it did not work so I went on my computer and tried and it worked.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,1,It said general error.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"I am truly not trying to sound negative or that I'm complaining, but your website is incredibly difficult to navigate. There are WAY to many things to look on every page that I go to. Perhaps student orders can show up as JUST their names with a drop down option if you want to see what they've ordered? I don't know... it's just really challenging every time I come to this site. Like I said, I'm NOT trying to complain... I LOVE children's books and I LOVE promoting them. I just have a really hard time on your website. Thank you",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,I can't find filters and I wanted to filter by price.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,2,"Very slow, site freezing.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,I was unable to find the book packs listed on the cover pages of the flyers sent to me.  I wasn't sure where to find them.   It was also difficult to see the text when I was viewing sample pages.  Sometimes I was able to get it to zoom in on the words by moving my mouse over and sometimes it would not.   It was also frustrating to have to keep clicking on the see full details button to read a description of the story.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"I read the tutorial, but found it a little difficult to navigate the site and look at books. After I ordered I realized there were a LOT more books to choose from than I had seen. Oh well, next time. The prices are good. Not all books had a description of the story",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,1,Rested an account one for each child then could not get to a place to order for youngest. I was stuck at the oldest.   Will go out and try again,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,I had trouble viewing the digital flyer.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"I am unsure if I sent the email to parents. I was in the middle of adding students and I was told that my time expired. However, when entering names, I thought I could download the list but I saw that all those names came up as one student. Then, I could not delete my error so I had to continue and add students  one at a time. This involved typing name, clicking add, having to click in box again to type another name., etc. Then time expired and I do not know what students I have listed.   I did not continue because it would take more time.    I did share the SBC to 2 of our new colleagues. I hope they do not get discouraged.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,Very slow to load,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,"The hover behavior where it opens a dialog when you're in the catalog view is a little weird, but it works.    Tried to search for ""how it's built"" books, and the search definitely seems like it could use improvement. No results for ""sailboat"" even though there's a sailboat book in there.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,"Below ,in this survey , you asked me if I need assistance ( which I don't ) , then my email was required regardless. Why?",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,5,"I completed the survery before I was able to put in my order for it popped up as I was about to do the order/bonus part of the website. The survey should come up at the end, not at the start.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,There were so many pop ups and notifications it was hard to see where I had to go and where to enter the actual order. Please make it more user friendly. thank you,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,I wish that you could also search for books by price.  I often have money to spend (earned rewards) and sometimes difficult to spend the exact amount.  Being able to search by price would help with this process.,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,I would love to be able to search books by reading level (vs. age level).,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,it logged me out after a few minutes of inactivity but once i logged back in all my items were still in my shopping cart,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"Maybe I am just missing it, but I really wish I could find books by the skill level of the reader better. My son has dyslexia and isn't reading at his grade level, so it makes finding books for him on this site difficult.",FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,It's not user friendly unless you are knowledgeable with the site,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,4,Some parts wouldn't load. It would also be nice if you could add to cart straight from the brochure page,FALSE,,,,
1/1/2001,,3,"When my account pulls up, it pulls up to my parent account.  I want it to pull up to my teacher account.  I guess I will have to cancel the parent account because otherwise I have to try to figure out how to see student orders- it's not very user friendly.    When you pull up the flyer view, it won't let you go to the next page if you zoom in to look at anything.
