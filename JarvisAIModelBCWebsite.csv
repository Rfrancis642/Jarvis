7/14/2022,Very Disappointed,"I have never had so many problems as I have had this past school year. I did a classroom campaign to raise money for books for my students. When I go back and look at every order I placed, it says the total was one thing, but I ended up paying a few dollars over that. I would never do that unless the original total had told me that's what it was. I received a handful of emails throughout the school year telling me I owed money for orders, when I paid straight away with the money in my classroom funds. This is ridiculous. I hate that I don't even want to use this website anymore because the kids love when they get free books from me. I have done this the last four years. But, the hassle everything has been this year is not worth it.",Account Balance/Payment

Its sad because I would be able to buy more books on a regular basis if they were cheaper.  Looks like I will be cutting back on my book purchases this year, and will have to buy my students other types of presents that are more affordable.

The other thing is I was unclear if I needed to go ahead and put the free book in the cart ahead of time, or if I was supposed to wait and shop for it at checkout. I did the latter.    When I did do the free book part, I was really impressed with how I could ""bank"" my current selection at the bottom of the UI while continuing to browse in case I found something better (which I did).
