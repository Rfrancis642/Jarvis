Satisfied,"Scholastic should automatically apply the coupons you email teachers, instead of relying on us to remember them a month later.  Also, if I enter an order at 9:30pm~ish California time - since I teach in California - on August 31st, it should not say that I entered the order on September 1st, since your incentives all end monthly so I make a point of entering my orders on the last day of each month.",Price

Satisfied,"I teach 6th grade math, but still provide book orders to my homeroom.  I usually don't get very many orders if any at all some months.   Because of this, I rarely reach the $25 order minimum for shipping and I end up paying for shipping out of my own money.   I don't see why this is necessary.  At one time I was an ""Apple Teacher"" or something like that and didn't have to pay for shipping.  Is that available anymore? Could you help me out somehow that I can provide book opportunities for my students, but not have to constantly pay for shipping out  of my pocket?  Thank you.  Brian Ogle",Price

I can’t find anywhere where I can just see my ewallet and its balance so I can simply confirm it even worked.     We are  now left to send my autistic daughter to school and can only hope  there’s money in this ewallet and she is not going to have a problem so she doesnt have a  meltdown if  there is no money, so thanks for that,  thanks for making this WAY more difficult than it should be,    So many other sites in the world that you could model a good users experience on this from…. why not just look at another site and do what they did?      why",Account Balance/Payment

The other thing is I was unclear if I needed to go ahead and put the free book in the cart ahead of time, or if I was supposed to wait and shop for it at checkout. I did the latter.    When I did do the free book part, I was really impressed with how I could ""bank"" my current selection at the bottom of the UI while continuing to browse in case I found something better (which I did).

Disappointed,"It is hard to navigate and find books quickly. Scholastic has made it extremely difficult to order ""$1"" books. I am sure Scholastic is aware of how many teachers get donations from friends, family, and even out of their own pocket to get books in the hands of our students and the company is making it so hard to do that. Raising prices, only allowing access to the $1 books after reaching a high order total first. One of my very large orders mysteriously got ""stuck"" and then I had to wait even longer to receive the order. This website and company is not as easy to order from as it once was.",Website- Filter/Search Options
