Disappointed,"There's a promotion where we as teachers can purchase a six pack of Kindness A to Z alphabet books for $7 that my friend told me about, but it's not available on the website. there's barely any hardcover option and it's often cheaper to just get the used hardcover on Amazon than the new paperback through Scholastic.",All Other
Disappointed,"Each and every time I click a new flyer, a separate tutorial wizard pops up.  Can't the site remember my choices for five minutes or at least mark that I've already done the silly thing once during this visit and don't need a refresher?    Once I zoom in on a book to read its page preview, the X button to click out of that book disappears, so I have to use the back arrow which kicks me out of the flyer I'm trying to shop.  Just bring me back to the normal view of the flyer, like a normal website.",Website Performance/Page Design

Actually, I usually end up going to Barnes and Noble or Amazon to buy instead even though I didn't have any intention of buying a book necessarily until after I failed on Scholastic.  Your site is TERRIBLE to use and has been for years.  There is literally not one book that shows up under young adult and you can't browse for books.  You have what's recommended by Scholastic and anything else is a nightmare to find.  You basically have to have a book in mind and then check and see if that author or title is listed.

I'm a technically literate software developer (not web though), but I guess every other site has put their UX on steroids to maximize conversion and retrained our brains?    The other thing is I was unclear if I needed to go ahead and put the free book in the cart ahead of time, or if I was supposed to wait and shop for it at checkout. I did the latter.    When I did do the free book part, I was really impressed with how I could ""bank"" my current selection at the bottom of the UI while continuing to browse in case I found something better (which I did).

I did find them in a series bundle purchase.  But I didn't want to buy the bundle because I already had many items within that bundle.  So I was a bit frustrated that I couldn't buy the single book when the day before, the single book was available and in my cart ready for purchase.
